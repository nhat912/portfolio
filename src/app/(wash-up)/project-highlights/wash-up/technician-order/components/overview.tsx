                To standardize the process and ensure consistent service quality for every order, we have implemented a set of instructions that technicians are required to follow. These procedures clearly outline the steps to be followed for each task and the expected outcomes. Finally, the technician must take photographs of the results to store the evaluation records directly in the technician&apos;s performance record.
