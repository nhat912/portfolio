                            In creating an insurance policy, gathering essential information and developing a comprehensive form may require further validation and refinement to ensure accuracy.

                            The insurance form interface has too many fields, making it challenging to review. Additional improvements are needed to enhance usability and better organize key sections like Coverage Period, Contact Details, and Vehicle Information.

                        <p>
                            To ensure accuracy and suitability, further guidance and adjustments from partnering insurance companies are needed, as the current data serves as a reference based on publicly available online documents.
                        </p>

                            To improve the insurance form interface, I reduced the number of fields and grouped related sections, such as Period of Insurance, Contact Details, and Vehicle Information, for easier review and usability.

                        So - When the user completes any section, it collapses for easy review and when you want to edit? Just click on the pencil icon.
                    </p>
                    <div className="mt-6 mb-8 relative w-full h-[562px]">

                    <p>
                        Moreover - Weâ€™ve added a progress bar at the top to visually indicate that the user&apos;s request is being processed. It provides updates on progress, estimated time, and active execution status.
                    </p>
                    <div className="my-6 relative w-full h-[121px]">

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        I expected the progress bar to be more intuitive, clearly showing the duration of each step. However, due to the project&apos;s urgency and limited staff, the CTO chose a simpler design (as shown above).
