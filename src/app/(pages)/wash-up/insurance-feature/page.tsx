                                The objective is to extend the platform&apos;s business scope while simultaneously developing a solution to streamline the purchase and management of insurance contracts for users.

                            <p>The vehicle insurance feature allows users to purchase insurance for their motorbikes or cars directly through the app and manage their policies efficiently.
                                Based on several surveys, many apps have developed this feature, but managing these policies typically requires owner checking codes on the insurance company&apos;s website or via email. Our goal is to introduce a feature that eliminates the need to sift through saved emails or remember individual codes needed to retrieve insurance records.

                                    Moreover, we also create a progress bar on the top of the page which serves as a visual cue, signifying that the user request is in the system, and the application is diligently working to record the information you’ve filled. These bars play a crucial role in informing users about ongoing processes, providing estimates on the expected duration, and indicating whether a request is actively being executed.

                                    I expected the progress bar to be more intuitive, clearly showing the duration of each step. However, due to the project&apos;s urgency and limited staff, the CTO chose a simpler design (as shown above).

                                In general, for the purchased insurance management feature, we focus on how to help users access information in the easiest way, the interface must be friendly and easy to use, and search tools must help customers find the insurance package they need quickly. On the other hand, the automatic renewal reminder feature is also included in our development goal to achieve the greatest convenience for our customers.

                                The app&apos;s insurance sales features provide a tool for buying and managing insurance policies. The app allows users to research and make informed decisions before purchasing an insurance policy. The inclusion of insurance management features that provide real-time customer support and automatic renewal reminders further enhances convenience and customer satisfaction.

                                Taken together, these features streamline the insurance sales process, reduce time and shorten traditional processes, and improve accessibility, making insurance administration more efficient and user-friendly. As a result, the app not only simplifies the insurance buying process, but also promotes more engaging and responsive interactions between insurers and their customers.
