                            This is a tiered product management tool. The admin needs to assign each product to relevant categories, starting with four test categories. When a seller wants to list a product for sale, they must select the appropriate categories from the admin-created list, it will make it easier for buyers to find the products they need.

                        <p className='leading-tight'>
                            My idea is to organize categories from large to small, displayed from left to right. When a level 1 category is selected, the corresponding level 2 category will appear, and so on for the subsequent levels. Admins can edit or delete categories by clicking the edit icon next to each one. However, I don&apos;t allow users to bulk deletion, as it could significantly impact the platform&apos;s product categories.
